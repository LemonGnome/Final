  <p>Sylvaneth are the only Age of Sigmar army that I own </p>
  <p>they are a tree based race of elves that use hit and run tactics on bored and are one of the few armys in A.O.S. that can still field their God as part of the army list </p>
  <p>Sylvaneth are the army I own the least amount of points of cause I only bought the spearhead which is a bundle box that comes with a small amount of units that can be considered battle ready</p>
